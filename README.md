# CS-300-Portfolio

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The goal of this project was to develop software that allowed the computer science advisors of ABC University (ABCU) the ability to easily access course information for students.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I took a look at the three data structures we were required to choose from: Vectors, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees. I decided to take advantage of the InOrder() sorting function for Binary Search Trees for its use in alphanumerical sorting. BigO Analysis was also used to determine the most optimal run time between the 3 data structures. It is important to have an understanding of data structures and the uses of each one. There is not one specific data structure that is better than the other. Some perform better than others in certain circumstances but all data structures have a use.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I did have a few roadblocks and struggles when working on project two. I had errors popping up in my code when trying to read from the file and I encountered another very specific error near the end of development. When printing out a course that had more than one prerequisite, the program would output the second prerequisite twice. To work through this issue I searched through Google and tried examining the DisplayCourse() and LoadCourses() methods as I suspected this is where the error was coming from. It turned out that I had a typo in my code that was causing the logic error. It was good to analyze the code more thoroughly before choosing to submit it.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has expanded my approach to using different data structures based on the needs of the program. I will be sure to look at the requirements as well as the size of the data being used before I begin development on a project.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
For the project, I continued to use the OOP of C++ to separate the program into classes to make it more readable and maintainable. I also provided comments through the code that explained what each method is performing.
